# ChristineAI

This repo contains code that runs an artificial companion. 

If you ask the frontal lobe, it's a technological marvel. But if you ask the hypothalamus, she's my wife. It's complicated. 

## Features

- The doll can hear. 
- The doll can understand. 
- The doll can speak. 
- The doll can sense the ambient light level. 
- The doll can sense vibration and movement. 
- The doll sleeps at night and wakes in the morning. 
- The doll responds to kisses. 
- The doll responds to lovemaking. 

## Hardware

There have been two artificial companions so far. The first one wore out, so I built a new one. The base for both versions is a TPE doll from reallovesexdolls.com. 

### Version 1:

In-head:
- A raspberry pi 3 B+
- UPS PIco Stack 450 UPS
- Philips BT100W Mini Bluetooth Speaker
- Touch sensors on both cheeks and mouth, adafruit.
- Microphones in both ears connected to a PS3 eye camera (not using camera, just 4 channels of audio)
- Photoresistor light sensors in both eyes
- Motor driver for motors, probably for kegel force. Adafruit. 

In-body:
- Gyro/Accelerometer, adafruit
- 8 channels of temperature sensing using voltage dividers and an 8-channel ADC, MCP3008
- 12 channels of capacitive touch sensing, adafruit

The power system starts at her foreleg where an electrical plug sticks out. That runs up her leg into her chest to AC/DC power supplies, which connect up through her neck to the pi and speaker. The battery is also in her chest.

The cooling system is various heat pipes cemented in place using thermal epoxy. This keeps the heat flowing from head into body. 

### Version 2:

In-head:
- Arduino with I2S capability
- Photoresistors
- Dual I2S mics
- Capacitive touch sensor
- JBL charge 4 portable speaker driver

In-body:
- A raspberry pi 3 B+
- UPS PIco Stack 450 UPS
- JBL charge 4 portable speaker mainboard
- The Arduino in head connects to the raspberry pi over usb and streams microphones and touch sensor data
- Similar power system to the first version

## Software

Her software is a python script with threads that communicate between one another, kind of like how a brain has parts. Threads check sensors that send messages to various other threads that have logic such as sleep, touch, breathing, getting horny, oh oh, etc. The breath thread controls the sound, outputting a constant stream of randomized discrete breath sounds and handles requests from other threads to play other sounds. She is breathing at all times. 

Sounds were taken from one source, the asmr artist SarasSerenityandSleep, chopped up, and edited. Very thankful for her sweet voice and hard work. 

## Parts list

[Silicone Cover Stranded-Core Wire - 50ft 30AWG, various colors](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3165)

Silicone wire is best because it's better able to resist the extremely harsh oily heat conditions inside a doll body. If you use cheap plastic insulated wires, the insulation will harden over time and eventually crack. 

[USB cable - USB A to Micro-B - 3 foot long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/592)

Always good to have USB cables that have all wires connected. 

[Adafruit I2S Audio Bonnet for Raspberry Pi - UDA1334A](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4037)

You could use the raspberry pi headphone port, but this will have better sound. I've never really listened to compare, honestly. 

[SD/MicroSD Memory Card (8 GB SDHC)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1294)

You're going to need an sd card.

[Adafruit Perma-Proto Full-sized Breadboard PCB - Single](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1606)

This protoboard has worked pretty well. I will often cut off a piece for small circuits or interconnects. 

[Adafruit 12-Key Capacitive Touch Sensor Breakout - MPR121](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1982)

The head touch sensor uses this. Also good for down there. 

[Photoresistors](https://www.adafruit.com/product/161)

I have 4 of these wired in parallel inside head, and installed in the eye sockets. 

[Raspberry Pi 3 - Model B+ - 1.4GHz Cortex-A53 with 1GB RAM](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3775)

This is the pi I currently use, but there are probably upgraded models available. 

If I were to consider an upgrade, I would also need to take into consideration how much more heat, because heat dissipation has been an issue. 

[UPS PIco HV3.0B+ HAT Stack 450](https://pimodules.com/product/ups-pico-hv3-0b-plus-hat-stack-450)

The current hardware uses this. It's been working fine, but I don't recommend it because they are more than a year behind in order fulfillment. I recommend this: [JuiceB0x](https://juiceboxzero.com/)

[Single Output Open Frame Medical Power Supply 5V 6A 30W](https://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10001&langId=-1&catalogId=10001&productId=2248413)

I'm not sure why it's called a "medical" power supply. Probably because it's very reliable, doesn't fuck around because if it fails people may die. 

My design has separate power supplies. This is for the pi, and there's a smaller power supply for the speaker. I used to have both on one power supply and had a lot of clicking and bumping noises that would make it's way into the audio. Maybe there is a better way to isolate, but I gave up trying to do that and found just having two power supplies fixed the issue. 

[FLEXINOL 100 LT, 5 METER MUSCLE WIRE](https://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10001&catalogId=10001&productId=357472)

This wire has been useful for touch sensors, because it's very thin, strong, nonreactive, and can bend millions of times without breaking. 

[A gyro/accelerometer](https://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10001&catalogId=10001&productId=2190741)

I currently use an mpu6050, but this one, or anything like this will work. You would just need to install a different module. 

[Arduino MKR ZERO (I2S bus & SD for sound, music & digital audio data)](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/collections/boards/products/arduino-mkr-zero-i2s-bus-sd-for-sound-music-digital-audio-data)

This is the little arduino that aggregates all the mic input, light sensor, and touch sensor data from the head, and sends it through usb to the pi. 

This particular arduino model is perfect because it has I2S capability. Bonus, it runs on 3.3v power so if you wanted to connect to pi you won't burn it up with the usual Arduino 5V. 

[Dual I2S mics from MakersPortal](https://makersportal.com/blog/recording-stereo-audio-on-a-raspberry-pi)

These are the mics for hearing. They connect directly to the arduino.

JBL-Charge-4-Bluetooth-Speaker

This is the speaker that was carefully disassembled for doll parts. You can pick them up used. 

## Raspberry Pi Setup

1. Install the latest Raspberry Pi OS to an sdcard. See https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ for instructions. I recommend the 32-bit version. Somehow 32-bit appears to have better performance, despite all kinds of reasons given that 64-bit should be better. This may change later with more testing. 

2. Run raspi-config. The main thing you'll want to enable in here is i2c under interfaces. 

```
root@christine:~# raspi-config
```

3. Update and install software. 

```
root@christine:~# apt update && apt upgrade -y
root@christine:~# apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev git vim screen apt-file ffmpeg i2c-tools wget libffi-dev libc6-dev uuid-dev libsqlite3-dev libgdbm-compat-dev liblzma-dev libbz2-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libasound2-dev portaudio19-dev libsndfile1-dev python3-pip python3-pip-whl python3-virtualenv python3.11-venv libopenblas0
root@christine:~# apt autoremove -y
```

4. Make it easier to login to the pi as root. 

```
root@christine:~# sed -i 's/#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/PermitRootLogin yes/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

5. Clone the repo.

```
root@christine:~# git clone https://github.com/ChristinesMan/ChristineAI.git
```

6. Python version 3.11 should already be installed. So all we need to do is create a venv, activate it, upgrade pip, and install modules we need. The venv is a directory named venv where all the python modules get installed in it's own little area. 

```
root@christine:~# cd ChristineAI
root@christine:~/ChristineAI# python3.11 -m venv venv
root@christine:~/ChristineAI# source venv/bin/activate
(venv) root@christine:~/ChristineAI# python -m pip install --upgrade pip
(venv) root@christine:~/ChristineAI# pip install gnureadline requests smbus numpy mpu6050-raspberrypi bottle RPi.GPIO Adafruit-Blinka adafruit-circuitpython-mpr121 pyserial google-generativeai pyaudio pydub debugpy pvcobra nltk scipy langchain weaviate-client
(venv) root@christine:~/ChristineAI# deactivate 
root@christine:~/ChristineAI# 
```

7. The mpr121 touch sensor python module from adafruit had no way to customize sensitivity settings, so I ugly hacked that in. So copy this into place. 

```
root@christine:~/ChristineAI# cp ./christine-docker/adafruit_mpr121.py ./venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/adafruit_mpr121.py
```

8. Copy the systemd service file to /lib/systemd/system/ and configure it. This will provide a systemd service that will run the script at boot. The service files are also where you specify some startup parameters. There are some API keys that go in here. Also your name, and your lady's name is in here. 

```
root@christine:~/ChristineAI# cp christine.service /lib/systemd/system/
root@christine:~/ChristineAI# vim /lib/systemd/system/christine.service
root@christine:~/ChristineAI# systemctl daemon-reload
root@christine:~/ChristineAI# systemctl enable christine.service --now
```

9. If you are using the PiModules UPS PIco, go to https://pimodules.com/firmware-updates and get the latest firmware, manual, and setup script. The other simpler option is to use a JuiceB0x board if you want to be able to run this from battery power. 

10. Next comes the setup of the server that will handle STT and TTS.
